# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __SQL INJECTION- BLUE Vulnerable________________

Vulnerability #2: ___Session Hijacking or Fixation Blue Vulnerable_______________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: __Cross-Site Scripting Green Vulnerable________________

Vulnerability #2: __user enumeration Green vulnerable________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: ___CSRF- Red Vulnerable_______________

Vulnerability #2: ____Insecure Data Object Reference- Red Vulnerable______________

##Bonus build on XSS
Build on Objective #4 (Cross-Site Scripting). Experiment to see if you can use XSS to: direct the user to a google
